    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>C103 is a brand that was built on innovation and creativity. Continuously challenging normal tastes, we do not conform to the norm. The idea of C103 originated in a small apartment room to address an issue in today’s clothing. With everything being mass-produced, quality is often compromised during the manufacturing process in most of today’s clothing brands. Longevity and consistency are two factors that seemed to get skimped on. On the other hand, any item that is made with high quality materials and labor is often very overpriced, and many people are not able to afford it. C103 was founded to provide high-quality clothing at a price-point that appeals to everyone, not just the wealthy and affluent.</p>
    <p>Every piece from any C103 collection is handmade in Sweden. We know quality is important to you, so quality is our emphasis during production. All products are made with the highest quality materials, all the way down to the stitching and printing. The makers are masters at their craft, with each maker having at least 10 years of experience in textiles manufacturing. Very strict quality controls are implemented in order to provide our best work to you, the customer.</p>
    <p>Aside from having quality that rivals the highest-end of designer clothing, C103 is redefining fashion culture. We strive to push our own imaginations so we can provide remarkable designs to you.</p>
    <p>We thank every single one of you for everything that you do for us. Without you, we would not be here today. Every C103 customer becomes part of our family, and we are here for you. If you have any suggestions, comments, compliments, or anything else, please feel free to contact us! Thank you again for your support in us.</p>
